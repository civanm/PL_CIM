Carlos IvÃ¡n Mercado Test

April 27th, 2015

Test Description:
	This project was created as a test to appy for a front end position;
	The source code, demo page and more details can be found here: [ https://github.com/civanm/PL_CIM ]

Why these Widgets:
	The idea was to take the widgedts I though were related and make a page functional, the choosen ones were:
	 -> The profile card: the page has the main information of the user 'logged in'
	 -> Form: user can send emails to his/her contacts and the ability to see the already sent
	 -> Charts tabs -> detailed statistics information related with the data usage, seemed to be a good widget to have in the page.
	 -> Top-Nav: it allows to the user to navigate between site's pages it is necessary in any page, it changes location and styles on mobile devices.

Technologies:

	- Angular JS as single page application aproach
	- Gulp to run automated task needed to the site develoment.
	- browserify used to require the application modules and node vendor files.
	- karma, jazmine, for unit testing and tdd.
	- angular-material, for the visual and grid layout
	- less, css pre-processor,that extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and more.
